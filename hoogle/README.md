Hoogle is a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search many standard
Haskell libraries by either function name, or by approximate type signature.

This package requires the following packages not available in Fedora:

* [ghc-process-extras](../ghc-process-extras)
* [ghc-storable-tuple](../ghc-storable-tuple)

On Fedora 27, ghc-warp-tls is currently available in updates-testing.
